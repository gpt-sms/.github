# GPTSMS

Welcome to the GPTSMS Organization on GitHub! Our mission is to make Artificial Intelligence (AI) accessible to everyone, regardless of their device or internet connectivity, by integrating the OpenAI API with SMS.

## Our Vision

We believe that AI has the potential to revolutionize the way we communicate, access information, and solve problems. However, not everyone has access to the latest devices or high-speed internet connections, which can limit their ability to benefit from these technological advancements. By harnessing the power of AI through SMS, we aim to bridge this digital divide and empower users across the globe.

## Why Support GPTSMS
Supporting the GPTSMS project means contributing to a more inclusive and connected world where everyone can benefit from AI technology. Your support helps us maintain and improve our infrastructure, expand our range of available phone numbers, and further develop the platform to better serve our users.

With your help, we can make AI accessible through SMS a reality for people who would otherwise be unable to take advantage of this powerful technology. By supporting GPTSMS, you're making a difference in the lives of countless individuals and playing a crucial role in democratizing access to AI.

Together, we can transform communication and make AI-powered assistance a reality for all.
