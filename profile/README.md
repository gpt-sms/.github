üëã Welcome to the **GPT SMS** Organization on GitHub!

Our mission is to make Artificial Intelligence (AI) accessible to everyone, regardless of their device or internet connectivity, by integrating the OpenAI API with SMS.

## üëÅ Our Vision

We believe that AI has the potential to revolutionize the way we communicate, access information, and solve problems.

However, not everyone has access to the latest devices or high-speed internet connections, which can limit their ability to benefit from these technological advancements.By harnessing the power of AI through SMS, we aim to bridge this digital divide and empower users across the globe.
